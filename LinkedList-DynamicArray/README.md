# Data Structures Performance Analysis

This section of the repository is dedicated to the study and analysis of fundamental data structures. Here, we have implemented dynamic arrays, singly and doubly linked lists in Python and rigorously tested their performance characteristics. 

## Data Structures

The data structures implemented in this repository include:

- **Dynamic Arrays**: Resizable arrays that allow elements to be added or removed dynamically.
- **Singly Linked Lists**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node in the list.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Similar to singly linked lists, but with nodes that also reference the previous node.

## Code

The code script includes:

- Functions for adding and removing elements at the beginning, end, and middle of the data structures.
- Search operations to locate a specific element within the structures.
- Benchmarks to measure the time complexity of each operation.
- Menu for testin various situation

The code provides practical examples of how each data structure operates and performs under various conditions.

## Experiments

Our examination covers:

- **Performance Timing**: We've measured the time taken for insertion and deletion operations at different points within the data structures to gauge efficiency.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Both theoretical and empirical analyses have been conducted to understand the computational complexity of the data structures.
- **Search Efficiency**: We've evaluated how quickly each data structure can find an element, impacting its usability for certain applications.

## Results and Report

Findings and analyses are compiled into the `DataStructues_LinkedLists-DynamicArray.pdf`, which includes:

- An in-depth discussion of the experimental design and testing procedures.
- Visual graphs and charts that illustrate the performance of the data structures across various metrics.
- A comprehensive exploration of the complexities associated with each data structure, contrasting theoretical predictions with actual measured performance.

The report provides a complete narrative from conceptual understanding to practical implications, reflecting the collaborative efforts made in studying these data structures.

_Note: This repository section is a culmination of joint work with a lab partner, demonstrating the collaborative spirit of scientific inquiry. All tests and benchmarks are conducted with a focus on transparency and academic rigor._
