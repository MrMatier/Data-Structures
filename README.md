# Data Structures Exploration

Welcome to the Data Structures Exploration repository, where I delve into the construction, analysis, and optimization of various data structures. This repository is a testament to collaborative learning and a shared space where both my lab partner and I merge our intellectual curiosity with practical programming skills.

## Repository Overview

Structured as a collection of directories, this repository documents our hands-on experience with fundamental and advanced data structures. Each directory houses code, documentation, and analysis of a particular data structure explored during our laboratory sessions and independent studies.

### Directories:

- **Linked Lists and Dynamic Array**: An exploration of single, double linked list implementations and their use-cases compared to Dynamic Array.
- **Other in near future**:
  
## Collaborative Projects

Each project within this repository has been developed in conjunction with my lab partner. We've employed pair programming techniques to foster a deeper understanding and have regularly peer-reviewed each other's code to ensure quality and reliability.

## Objectives

The main goals of this repository are to:

- Implement various data structures in a programming environment, specifically in Python.
- Analyze the efficiency of operations performed on these data structures.
- Understand the real-world applicability of different data structures and their impact on algorithm performance.

## Documentation and Analysis

Alongside source code, each directory contains a comprehensive report that dissects the performance and application of the implemented data structures:

- **Technical Reports**: Detailed documentation of each data structure's design, our implementation process, and any challenges encountered along the way.
- **Performance Analysis**: Empirical analysis and comparative study of operation complexities and their efficiencies.
