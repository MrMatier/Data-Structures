# Data Structures Exploration

Welcome to the **Data Structures Exploration** repository, where I delve into the construction, analysis, and optimization of various data structures using C++. This repository is a testament to collaborative learning and a shared space where both my lab partner and I merge our intellectual curiosity with practical programming skills.

## Repository Overview

Structured as a collection of directories, this repository documents our hands-on experience with fundamental and advanced data structures. Each directory houses code, documentation, and analysis of a particular data structure explored during our laboratory sessions and independent studies.

### Directories:

- **Linked Lists and Dynamic Array**: An exploration of singly and doubly linked list implementations and their use-cases compared to dynamic arrays.

- **Priority Queue Implementations: Dynamic Array vs Heap**: A study and comparison of priority queue implementations using dynamic arrays and heaps. This includes performance analysis and practical applications of both data structures.

- **Hash Tables: BST-Based and Cuckoo Hashing Implementations**: Implementation and analysis of hash tables using Binary Search Trees for collision resolution and Cuckoo Hashing. This project explores different hashing techniques and their efficiencies.

## Collaborative Projects

Each project within this repository has been developed in conjunction with my lab partner. We've employed pair programming techniques to foster a deeper understanding and have regularly peer-reviewed each other's code to ensure quality and reliability.

## Objectives

The main goals of this repository are to:

- **Implement** various data structures in a programming environment, specifically in C++.
- **Analyze** the efficiency of operations performed on these data structures.
- **Understand** the real-world applicability of different data structures and their impact on algorithm performance.

## Documentation and Analysis

Alongside source code, each directory contains comprehensive reports that dissect the performance and application of the implemented data structures:

- **Technical Reports**: Detailed documentation of each data structure's design, our implementation process, and any challenges encountered along the way.

- **Performance Analysis**: Empirical analysis and comparative study of operation complexities and their efficiencies.

### Project Summaries

#### **Linked Lists and Dynamic Array**

This project involves the implementation of dynamic arrays, singly linked lists, and doubly linked lists. We conducted rigorous performance testing to compare these data structures in terms of insertion, deletion, and search operations. The code provides practical examples and includes a menu for testing various scenarios.

#### **Priority Queue Implementations: Dynamic Array vs Heap**

In this project, we implemented priority queues using two different data structures:

- **Priority Queue using Dynamic Array**: Utilizes a dynamic array to store elements along with their priorities, maintaining elements in order based on priority.

- **Priority Queue using Heap**: Implements a max-heap for efficient management of elements, ensuring optimal time complexity for insertion and extraction.

We performed experiments to measure the performance of various operations and analyzed the results in a detailed report, including visual graphs and complexity discussions.

#### **Hash Tables: BST-Based and Cuckoo Hashing Implementations**

This project focuses on two hashing techniques:

- **Hash Table with BST (Separate Chaining)**: Uses Binary Search Trees in each bucket to handle collisions, allowing efficient storage and retrieval.

- **Cuckoo Hashing**: Implements the cuckoo hashing algorithm with three hash functions and multiple tables, aiming for constant time complexity in search operations.

We examined the performance, load factors, and collision resolution efficiency of both methods. The findings are compiled in a comprehensive report with comparative analysis.

## Note This repository is a culmination of joint work, demonstrating the collaborative spirit of scientific inquiry. All tests and benchmarks are conducted with a focus on transparency and academic rigor. We encourage you to explore the code, read the reports, and provide any feedback or suggestions.
